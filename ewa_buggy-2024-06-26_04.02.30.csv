This genus is commonly referred to as ""leaf cutter bees"" due to the tendency of many species to cut circular or oval pieces of leaves for nest construction. However, there are exceptions within the genus; some species utilize tree resin or chewed vegetation and mud in addition to leaf fragments.

Characterized by large chewing mandibles and scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on the underside of females' abdomens, Megachile species, including M. centuncularis, typically exhibit dark bodies with light hair bands across their abdomens in both genders. Male M. centuncularis possess unmodified forelegs and resemble females but with longer antennae and lacking scopae. Medium-sized, they typically measure between 8-11 mm in length.","Bees, Wasps, and Sawflies","/img/uploads/posts/2024-04-10/_apu_2024-04-10_66170292a4698Megachile-55162375-jpeg.jpeg","Megachile centuncularis","1","10","Adult","Foraging","Reviewed (CO): CO-N: Reviewed / Inform Anecdata its taxonomy is missing Megachile centuncularis / Note this record is used as an illustration of the Buggy methodology in the EwA Bug Monitoring presentation (https://tinyurl.com/EwA-Searching4Bugs)","Flowers or flower buds // Open flowers // Mature leaf","Echinacea purpurea (eastern purple coneflower)","No","/img/uploads/posts/2024-04-10/_apu_2024-04-10_661706230ba9cEPC-jpeg.jpeg","Walking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Did split the record into 2: Polistes fuscatus at 18 mm (The length of P. fuscatus often ranges between 15 and 21 mm), the black wasp looks like Monobia quadridens (Four-toothed mason wasp). Discussion with Tori about the host identification (originally recorded as a European holly). There is a bit of ambiguity between the European and the American holly. There are American holly specimens in our area that are more shiny than dull. So, looking at the leaf as a secondary key. The leaf shape in the record seems closer to the American holly: leaf margins are straighter between spines than the European holly, where there is a pronounced curve between the spines.  I'll relax to genus for now until we get more firm on the identification. TODO: Inform Anecdata its taxonomy is missing the species Monobia quadridens, and the genus Ilex.
