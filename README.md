Prototype of a data visualization app for [Project Buggy](https://www.anecdata.org/projects/view/1208) by [Earthwise Aware](https://www.earthwiseaware.org/) on [Anecdata](https://www.anecdata.org) using R Shiny.

Uses downloaded data from Project Buggy observations to visualize arthropod-plant interactions by species. Working on biomass calculation page, Anecdata API integration for real-time data, and improved visualization.

Documentation soon to come!
